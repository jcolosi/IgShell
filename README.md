# IgShell
Aliases and functions to improve usability of BASH shell.

A set of usability enhancements that make the BASH shell more visual and navigable.  For example, when changing directories, the screen is cleared and a new directory list is created.
Also, the listing is numbered and you can change to a new directoy, or open as a file by simply entering the listing number.
